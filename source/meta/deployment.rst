Deployment & Extension
------------------------

``Archimedes`` and its services are meant to be deployed across its machines via Docker-Swarm and Ansible. This will be configurable via 
a **single** script, and the corresponding commandline tools will help orchestrate the provisioning of nodes and 
additional services as and when they are built. To this end, the API reference document will detail how the service will be designed,
as well as how to integrate additional features into it.
