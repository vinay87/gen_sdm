``Archimedes`` is a `Simulation Process & Data Management System`, developed by the GKN Driveline Global Expert Network (GEN) Team, that is
targetted towards core-engineering processes which integrate `Computer Aided Analysis` or
`Computer Aided Engineering`. Any process that involves `CAE` can benefit from these services and tools.

The goal of the SDM is to craft a service that is, by core definition, easy to use and integrate. Ease of use is paramount in an environment that has
people of varying temperments and experience. In fact, at first glance, the SDM should be so easy to use that to do their work otherwise should seem
counter-intuitive and time-consuming.

This documentation site details how `Archimedes` was conceptualized, how it is being developed and the roadmap for the development.
